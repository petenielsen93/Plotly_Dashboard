# Plotly_Dashboard
In this module, we created a dashboard using JS and HTML to filter through demographic information regarding each volunteer of the study. In this challenge, we created visualizations of each using Plotly, creating a bar, bubble, and gauge chart to visualize different factors. We then customized the page using HTML and Bootstrap. 

When the dashboard is first opened, the information for ID 940 is displayed and the three charts should be displaying his/her information. The information panel and charts will dynamically update every time a new ID number is selected from the box.
